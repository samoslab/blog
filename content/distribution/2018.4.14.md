Distribution Plan of SAMO



Samos is a blockchain based service network which enables businesses to adapt to the blockchain world.

Our token is named SAMO which its primary use is for proof of work within the Samos networking. SAMO is not for sale. 

It will be distributed to everyone who contributed to the Samos community and provides services to the Samos service network.

# Distribution Plan

The max supply of SAMO is 300M and no additional mechanism. We use “InitialUnlockedCount” to control the distribution of SAMO at the beginning.

The InitialUnlockedCount(40 addresses) will be unlocked by default. Tokens from these 40 addresses will be ready for initial tokens distribution and Samos Storage Service.

The total 300M SAMO will be distributed in not less than 15 years.

The distribution principle will be adjusted accordingly with the development of the entire Samos service network.
